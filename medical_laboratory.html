<h1>how much water should you drink per day?</h1>
<p>health experts often recommend people to eight 8 -ounce glasses of water per day. this is commonly known as "8*8" rule. it may not apply to everyone, though your body is about 60 percent water.</p>
<p>the body constantly loses water throughout the day, mostly through urine and sweat but also from regular body functions like breathing. to prevent dehydration, yuo need to get plenty of water from drink and food every day.</p>
<p>there are many different opinions on just how much water you should be drinking</p>
<p>health experts commonly recommend eight 8-ounce glasses, which equals about 2 liters, or half a gallon a day. this is called the 8*8 rule and is very easy to remember.</p>
<p>however, some experts believe that you need to sip on water constantly thought the day, even when you are not thirsty</p>
<p>as with most things, this depends on the individual. many factors(both internal and external) ultimately affect how much water you need.</p>
