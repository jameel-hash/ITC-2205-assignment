<h1> Factor </h1>
<p> one of the fist things you will need to learn about before tackling prime and composite numbers are factors. factor are what you will have to mutiply together in order to get a certain number. so for example, the factors of 18 is 2 and 9 since 2*9=18. the divisor definition is a number that another number is to be dividedwith. in this case, 2 and 9 are each also known as a divisor. </p>
<h1> Prime numbers </h1>
<p> so what are prime numbers? prime numbers are numbers that can only be factored by 1 and itself. an example of this is 2. you cannot get an answer of 2 in multiplication other than multiplying 2 with 1.2 is known as a prime divisor. </p>
<h1> Composite numbers </h1>
<p> contrary to prime numbers, composite numbers are numbers that have more factors that just 1 and itself. it also is positive. for example, 9 can be factored in to 3*3 or it can be 9*1. all whole numbers are either prime or composite, other than the number 1 and 0. 0has an infinite amount of factors, whereas 1 cannot be made up of any thing that is not itself. </p>
